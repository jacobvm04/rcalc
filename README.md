# RCalc

Have you ever been twiddling your thumbs waiting for your calculator to finish calculating? Probably not, but here's an over-engineered solution anyway

`rcalc` is the fastest calculator for your terminal out there. `rcalc` carries out your math calculations üî• blazingly fast by compliling your expressions to Web Assembly on the fly üî• üòé

I built this project mostly as a way to learn about writing [parser cominbators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) in rust using `chumsky` along with the basics of Web Assembly code generation and JIT execution using `wasm-encoder` and `wasmtime`.

### Usage

```sh
> rcalc '1 + 1 * 2 / 4'
1.4998751
```

### Malformed input example

```sh
‚ùØ rcalc 2 -+3
Failed to parse input expression
Error: found + expected '(', or '-'
   ‚ï≠‚îÄ[<unknown>:1:4]
   ‚îÇ
 1 ‚îÇ 2 -+3
   ‚îÇ    ‚î¨
   ‚îÇ    ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ found + expected '(', or '-'
```

## Installation

To install `rcalc`, clone this repo and run `cargo install --path .` in the cloned directory. Do note that this project requires a `nightly` copy of rust to build.

## Tests

This project uses `proptest` for property based testing. To run the tests, simply run

```sh
> cargo test # or `cargo nextest run` if you have `cargo-nextest` installed
```

For code coverage, install `cargo-llvm-cov` and run

```sh
cargo llvm-cov
```
